# Introduction
This project is a real-time coding web-app created using React.js (For the Frontend) and Socket.io (For Backend). Additionally, it uses the glot.io API in order to run custom code. It supports various languages (And additional support can be added).

# Getting started
To get started, clone this reprository and make node.js is installed. Then, you can run the app using "npm start" on the parent directory and "node index" on the "server" directory.

# Customization

Furthermore, on variables.js in the "src" directory, it is possible to alter the URL address of the backend server. Similarly, this can be done in the server directory on variables.js, where you alter the URL address of the frontend client.
