# Introduction
This project is a real-time coding web-app created using React.js (For the Frontend) and Socket.io (For Backend). Additionally, it uses the glot.io API in order to run custom code. It supports various languages (And additional support can be added).

# Customization
For starters, you can choose to keep my API key from glot or paste in your own in the .env file. Furthermore, on variables.js in the "src" directory, you can alter the URL address of the backend server. Similarly, this can be done in the server directory on variables.js.
